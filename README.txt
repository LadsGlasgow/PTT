Project Description:
Before the start of each term or semester, the class directors produce a list of teaching requirements which we must try and fill. Our administrator will then attempt to find suitable staff and organise training for them. The code is designed to effectively address these requriements.


File structure:
1. "src/": source code
1. "out/": executable compiled file
3. "test_data": test data file



How to run the code:
1. cd to the directory: out/PTT
2. Use command "java Application "
